# The Event Finder
_The Event Finder_ is a WearOS and iOS app to find new events, made as a part of the "SwiftUI 2.0 Apps on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Watch & TV" course on Udemy. 

The course is an intermediate Swift course that focuses on the funtamentals of SwiftUI, including building the app for several iOS platforms, where I have focused on the mobile and watch implementation.

**From the course website:** "You'll get to learn the true magic of SwiftUI as we get to reuse a size-able chunk of our codebase across each platform. And, you'll see how to craft your apps for each platform to truly take advantage of each device to thrill your users. Make Apps and Widgets for iOS 14, macOS 11, watchOS 7 and tvOS 14 using Xcode 12, Swift 5, WidgetKit and Apple Watch"
